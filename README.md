### Overview

You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:

* Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?
* Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions?

### Analyse and Methods

* Do some exploratory data works before getting start.
* Use the automatic transmission , the manual transmission and both as the preditors to make OLS regression of the outcome MPG respectively and make some tests and plots to find out which one or both is a better preditor.
* Understand the coefficients and residuals
* Because MPG might be influenced by many other variables in the dataset, make a multivariable regression is reasonable as well.
